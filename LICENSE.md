# Open Journal Theme – License

This license grants you, the user, an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the theme.

---

## Using the theme

You are licensed to use the theme to create one single End Product for yourself or for one client (a "single application"), and the End Product can be distributed for Free.

The End Product is a customised implementation of the theme. For example: the end product is the final website customised with your content.

---

## What you CAN do with the theme

You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client.

You can make any number of copies of the single End Product, as long as the End Product is distributed for Free.

You can modify or manipulate the theme. You can combine the theme with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license.

---

## What you CAN'T do with the theme

You can't Sell the End Product, except to one client.

You can't re-distribute the theme as stock, in a tool or template, or with source files. You can't do this with the theme either on its own or bundled with others, and even if you modify the theme. You can't re-distribute or make available the theme as-is or with superficial modifications. These things are not allowed even if the re-distribution is for Free.

You can't use the theme in any application allowing an end user to customise a digital or physical product to their specific needs, such as an "on demand", "made to order" or "build it yourself" application.

---

## Other license terms

Some components of the theme are sourced from elsewhere and different license terms may apply to the component, such as someone else's license or an open source or creative commons license. The other license will apply to that component instead of this license. This license will apply to the rest of the theme.

You can only use the theme for lawful purposes.

This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the theme from it.

## Attribution

Open Journal is based on the Journal theme, originally created for a different static site generator. This Astro port maintains the visual design while modernizing the underlying architecture.
